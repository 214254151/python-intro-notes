In Python, variables are used to store and manipulate data. 
Python is a dynamically typed language, which means you don't need to declare the data type of a variable explicitly. 
Here's an introduction to variables in Python:

## Variable Declaration:
In Python, you declare a variable simply by assigning a value to it. There's no need to specify the data type. For example:

```
my_variable = 42
```
In this example, my_variable is declared and assigned the integer value 42.
